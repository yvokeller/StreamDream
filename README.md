# About
StreamDream is a Streaming service based on node.js.

Some core features include:
- Maintaining an own library of movies & series in an app that can be run on a home server
- Remote control functionality based on websockets that allows login on a second device to control playback
- Connection to OMDB API to automatically import series or movies including relevant metadata & thumbnails into the library

# Disclaimer
This is a project I worked on during my apprenticeship a few years back and is no longer maintained.
